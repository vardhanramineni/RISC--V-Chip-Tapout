# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program - VSD

This repository documents of my learning experience in the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**.  
The program is designed to train participants in the **end-to-end chip design flow**: from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.

## Getting Started — Week 0

| Task | Focus Area | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| [Task 0](Week0/Task0/README.md) | Environment setup and installation of required EDA tools | Completed |

### Outcomes from Week 0
- Installed and verified **Icarus Verilog, Yosys, GTKWave, ngspice, qrouter, and Magic**.  
- Learned to configure the Ubuntu environment for smooth execution.  
- Established a strong base for upcoming RTL-to-GDSII design experiments.
